## APCS1 Final Project: Command Line Based Movie Rental Kiosk
### Project Description
<i> Our team plans to create a movie rental kiosk where users will be able to access nearly all movies after the year 2000. They will be able to search by genre, title, director, cast, and date of release. There will be an implemented credit card system and a UI that will guide the user through the process of renting a movie. </i>
