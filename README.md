## APCS1 Final Project: Command Line Based Movie Rental Kiosk
### Project Description
<i> Our team plans to create a movie rental kiosk where users will be able to access nearly all movies after the year 2000. They will be able to search by genre, title, director, cast, and date of release. There will be an implemented credit card system and a UI that will guide the user through the process of renting a movie. </i>

## Instructions
1. Compile and run Woo.java
2. Follow the on-screen instructions for each step of the rental process
  * Enter your credit card information or get a new credit card
  * Search for a movie using key terms, genre, release year, etc.
  * Rent the movie you want
  * Later, return the movies you have out (you may be charged a late fee if you don't return it on time)
