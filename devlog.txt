Command Line-Based Movie Rental Kiosk

===== TO DO LIST =====
1) Update DEVLOG
2) Update README (credit cards to debit cards)
3) Implement Calendar in DebitCard as well as make a driver class to test Calendar and kiosk return function
4) Refine S.O.P statements for clarity and aesthetics. **unable to fully achieve in the limited time we had**
============================================================================================================

/////////// Zone of Reflection \\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Found a way to access the top one hundredish movies from 2006 to 2017 by
using a python program that was written to access data from IMDB.
* Figured out how to give user access to the rest of the movies in movies.csv through specific search terms by
creating a local ArrayList<String> to store the movies that pertain to the search terms and add to it via a for loop.


UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Could not implement Calendar and a fast forward method.
* Some of the search options are not reliable and return the incorrect movie when the user provides input.
* Unable to find a good place in our decisionMaking method in Kiosk.java to incorporate the moreInfo method from Movie.java.
** Instance vars money in DebitCard.java always "refreshes" back to $1000, instead of the current balance of the specific card.
=======
* Joan managed to compile a list of over 1000 of the top movies from 2006 to
2017 by writing a Python program that pulled information from IMDB with
minimal user input. The program was, in a way, a one time use kind of program,
so it is not included

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Fully utilizing Calendar to make the user pay extra when a movie is overdue
* The user does not have access to the rest of the movies available from Movie.java.
* Calendar was unable to be fully implemented due to time constraints. This
means that the user doesn't pay extra to return a movie
* There is no way for a user to return a movie yet


COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The Calendar class is not only able to return the current date and time,
it can also manipulate the system time and date.
* CSV files are really useful for storing Strings and other information that can be parsed.

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"We changed ___ to ___ bc...""

We changed CreditCard.java to DebitCard.java to better reflect a user's balance stored onto a card.
We changed Numbers.csv from only having card numbers and pins to also containing their balance and rentals they have not returned
in order to better fulfil our goal of a working Kiosk.

<<<<<<< HEAD

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A program involving lots of conditionals and branching requires lots of debugging - emphasis on lots - due to the many possible situations.
Limited time causes lots of "cuts" of ideas... (ex. Calendar, moreInfo, etc.)



=======
* Joan fixed the rent method to allow the user to rent any movie in our list.
This was done so a user can rent a movie before searching just by knowing the
name.

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* We learned that communication is key when doing group work
* We also learned that properly commenting your code as you write it is vital
to other's understanding and your own
